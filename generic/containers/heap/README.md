# Generic Heap

This is a LITERAL COPY from the Go standard library because there is not yet a genric version of the `containers/heap` module in the Go 1.18 beta 1 release. I am sure this will come out in Go 1.18 or in a subsequent release shortly thereafter. This library is meant to be a bridge until that is done and nothing more.

Please do not use this for anything outside the lazylru module because it _will_ be deleted as soon as a generic heap is available in the stardard library.
